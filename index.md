## Considering seeing a physiotherapist?

There are many times in a person's life when a physiotherapist may help them, and as a physiotherapist in Manitoba, I hope to bring some clarity to when seeing a physiotherapist may be right for you. 

Our primary goal as physiotherapists is to help people get moving again. For a number of reasons, our ability to move around the world can become difficult. Physiotherapists are trained to assess and treat these movement difficulties. Whether it's a medical condition, a minor injury or chronic pain, we are able to help you restore your function.
