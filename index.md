## Considering seeing a physiotherapist?

There are many times in a person's life when a physiotherapist may help them, and as a physiotherapist in Manitoba, I hope to bring some clarity to when seeing a physiotherapist may be right for you. 

Our primary goal as physiotherapists is to help people get moving again. For a number of reasons, our ability to move around the world can become difficult. Physiotherapists are trained to assess and treat these movement difficulties. Whether it's a medical condition, a minor injury or chronic pain, we are able to help you restore your function. 

### Who pays for physiotherapy?

Physiotherapy provided in private clinics is not covered under Manitoba Health Insurance. This is the case for all private clinics in Manitoba that offer physiotherapy services. If you have third-party insurance coverage (such as insurance provided through your work), there is often a portion of it that covers the cost of physiotherapy sessions. 

Most clinics offer direct billing to most third-party insurance companies including, but not limited to: Manitoba Public Insurance, Workers Compensation Board of Manitoba, Canada Life, Blue Cross, Green Shield and Sun Life.

### What if I have to pay out-of-pocket for physiotherapy?

Clients have the option to pay out-of-pocket for physiotherapy. It is important to note that physiotherapy fees paid directly by a client are tax free and qualify as a medical expense for income tax purposes.

For individuals with financial need seeking non-emergency medical care (including physiotherapy), [WISH Clinic](https://wishclinic.ca/) at Mount Carmel Clinic offers a wide range of medical services free of charge.
