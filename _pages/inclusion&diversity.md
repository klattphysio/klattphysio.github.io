# Inclusion & Diversity

Each day I strive to approach every person I meet with an attitude of understanding, appreciation and acceptance. These values are the foundation for how I interact with individuals both in and out of the clinic. I believe that our uniqueness is meant to be embraced and fully expressed, and I hope to provide a space where anyone who steps foot in my office feels that they can express who they are to their full extent.

Within our clinic we aim to create a safe space that celebrates diversity. We endeavour to offer our services to people from different backgrounds that vary by:

* ability
* age
* ethnicity
* gender identity 
* gender expression
* languages spoken
* national origin  
* religious beliefs
* sexual orientation

We are committed to combating stigma and shame that may prevent individuals from seeking help within the health care system, and work to create a safe environment that is free from:

* ableism
* fatphobia
* homophobia
* racism
* religious intolerance
* transphobia
