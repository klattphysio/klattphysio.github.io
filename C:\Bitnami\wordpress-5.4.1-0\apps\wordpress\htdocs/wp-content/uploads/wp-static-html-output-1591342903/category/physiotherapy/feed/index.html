<p>Gaming keyboards are one of the best tools that I&#8217;ve come across for general computer work. They provide many benefits to the user for ergonomics depending on how weird of a keyboard you&#8217;re willing to use, but for the general user that does not want to learn a new layout, switching to a mechanical keyboard can be enough to decrease typing fatigue through the workday. The biggest benefit to using a mechanical keyboard is the decreased pressure required to activate the switch in each key. This is different depending on the specifications of the switch, and comes down to personal preference. (My favourite being Cherry Browns)</p>
